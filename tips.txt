Behavioural Cloning Tips 

-essential that the car drives down the center of the road 
-drive counterclockwise to aid in generalizing the model
-flipping the images is a quick way to augment the data
-collecting data from the second track possibly 
-donâ€™t collect too much data
-use SCP to copy data to EC2 instance
-use python csv library to extract data
-look into ipynb notebook for better image visualiztion during preprocessing step 

TODOs: 
-implement simple two layer network to start off w/ keras
-implement Nvidia Net 
-do lots of image preprocessing 
-think/read about recovery case for car and sharp turns
